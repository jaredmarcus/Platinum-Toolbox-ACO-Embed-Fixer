# Platinum-Rentals-ACO-Embed-Fixer
The premise of making this was I hated how ACO runners couldn't showcase live their checkouts/splashpasses to their customers, as most of the invidivuals were familar with programming. Hence where this program came into place. I created this program to showcase their success live, while removing sensitive info (Proxy utilized, Profile name, etc.) There was a piece of software out there that goes by the name of Soleware, but discontinued their support for editting embeds (likely as many bots over the course of time edit their embed format). This software is presently used by many notable groups, such as Malice in their Malice Muse section. To obtain a key DM me on Discord: Frostyyy#2884. The software is free to use until I deem that it's suitable to go paid. When there is a paid phase it would be something minimal such as $10/M via Hyper.co. Some ACO Servers out there do have some sort of feature like this, but not readily available for people to utilize with a couple clicks. The program was made as an `.exe` due to the fact I know users utilize window servers and can leave this running with little to no performace impact on the computer.

## Features
> Delete Sensitive Information From Checkouts/3DS/SplashPass Embeds

> Utilizes a Bot token to parse embeds and resend to another channel (without utilizing webhooks, preferred to bypass webhook ratelimits). Meaning you can have the bot in a private server, and a public server. Have the bot read from the private server, and display to the public server. 

> Alongside sharing information between 2 servers, software can also resend to another server via a webhook (good incase you can't add a bot to that server). 

> Optional ability to send different embed types from bots, login sessions, test webhooks, declines, etc. 

> Channels are added/removed via a command to ease the configuration process, and remain persistent between bot restarts

> Discord Presence
