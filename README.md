# Platinum-Toolbox-ACO-Embed-Fixer
The premise of making this was I hated how Auto Checkout (ACO) service runners couldn't showcase live their checkouts/splashpasses to their customers, as most of the invidivuals were not familar with programming. Hence where this program came into place. I created this program to showcase their success live, while removing sensitive info (Proxy utilized, Profile name, etc.). There was a piece of software out there that goes by the name of Soleware, but discontinued their support for editting embeds (likely as many bots over the course of time edit their embed format). This software is presently used by many notable groups, such as Malice in their Malice Muse section. 
To obtain a key DM me on Discord: Frostyyy#2884. 
The software is free to use until I deem that it's suitable to go paid. When there is a paid phase it would be something minimal such as $10/M via Hyper.co. Some ACO Servers out there do have some sort of feature like this, but not readily available for people to utilize with a couple clicks. The program was made as an `.exe` due to the fact I know users utilize window servers and can leave this running with little to no performace impact on the computer.

# Program Status
Deprecated as of January 2022. Due to the fact sneaker/retail botting is not as big as it used to be during the COVID era.
